    <h2>What are microplastic:</h2>
    <p>Microplastics is a young research area with many unknowns. Science, industry, and politics are facing enormous challenges in order to grasp the phenomenon in all its complexity and to find the effective solutions against the further spread of microplastics. If we want to understand what is hidden behind the term and research field of microplastics, we must direct our attention to the way we deal with plastics: from production and use to disposal or reuse. Here we have put together a few facts about the current situation. </p>
    <p>Did you know?
        Microplastics can come from a variety of sources including larger plastic pieces that have broken apart, resin pellets used for plastic manufacturing, or in the form of microbeads, which are small, manufactured plastic beads used in health and beauty products.
        Microplastics come from a variety of sources, including from larger plastic debris that degrades into smaller and smaller pieces. In addition, microbeads, a type of microplastic, are very tiny pieces of manufactured polyethylene plastic that are added as exfoliants to health and beauty products, such as some cleansers and toothpastes. These tiny particles easily pass through water filtration systems and end up in the ocean and Great Lakes, posing a potential threat to aquatic life.
        Microbeads are not a recent problem. According to the United Nations Environment Programme, plastic microbeads first appeared in personal care products about fifty years ago, with plastics increasingly replacing natural ingredients. As recently as 2012, this issue was still relatively unknown, with an abundance of products containing plastic microbeads on the market and not a lot of awareness on the part of consumers.

    <h2>Types of Microplastics:</h2>
    <p>●The Primary Microplastics Type A categorizes and regards microplastics as a chemical.
        This category includes the types that are added directly to products (e.g. personal care products, cleaning agents, paints, etc.). This proportion is already often replaced by water-soluble polymers ("liquid microplastics"). Products are then often "advertised" with the addition "free of microplastics" or "without microplastics".</p>
        
        <p>●The category Primary Microplastics Type B includes plastic particles that are created through the use of plastic products and that are directly (without detours) released into the environment as microplastics.</p>
        
        <p>●Secondary microplastics include all microplastic particles that are formed in the environment as a result of the slow decay of large plastic parts. This can happen through all kinds of external influences, e.g. through the influence of UV rays, bacteria or friction.</p>

        <h2>How Do Microplastics Enter Environment</h2>
        <p>In general, a distinction is made between indirect and direct entry routes. Indirect entry paths are found when plastic objects break down into smaller and smaller components due to UV radiation, oxidation and / or mechanical effects. Ultimately, millions of microplastic particles are created in our ecosystems (Law et al., 2014). Depending on their individual composition, they distribute quickly or slowly in water, soil, and the air.

            Microplastics can also get into the environment directly: through tire abrasion, synthetic textile fibers that are released when clothes are washed, care products such as peelings that contain microplastic particles. Industrial wastewater is also one of the major sources of input. (Boucher et al., 2017)
            
            The proximity to heavily populated areas and inadequate waste management lead to particularly high levels of contamination. Point sources such as sewage treatment plants or the plastics industry are also important influencing factors. Furthermore, contamination with microplastics is influenced by transport processes such as wind, water currents, ebb and flow and surface runoff from rain.
            
            In general, limnic ecosystems are more heavily contaminated with microplastics than marine ecosystems, since microplastics can be distributed more widely in the enormous volume of marine ecosystems. Plastic and microplastics collect in so-called "garbage patches" because of converging ocean currents.

            <h2>How can Microplastics be Detected:</h2>
            <p>●Methods for the detection of microplastics are also discussed and researched. So far, there is no simple, standardized, and fast analytical method that can also be used outside of laboratories in real water and that can detect microplastics in different environmental matrices as reliably and reproducibly as possible. Due to the use of very different procedures, the data collected so far are difficult to compare and are often not very meaningful. This is one of the main reasons why there are still no limit values or political guidelines for dealing with microplastics. An efficient identification and quantification of microplastic pollution is a great scientific challenge, because as the size of the particles (nano plastics) decreases, it becomes more and more difficult to recognize and detect them. Micro- and nano plastics that have not been detected can easily lead to the fallacy that they do not exist. In the environment especially:</p>

            <h2>TO BEAT MICROPLASTICS: REUSE,RECYCLE,REORIENT:-</h2>
 <P>●It’s entirely possible to meet UNEP’s ambitious goal of reducing plastic waste by 80% in the next two decades. The changes we need to make as consumers are necessary, affordable, and achievable by implementing three market shifts.</P>

<p>●Eliminating unnecessary common plastics such as excessive packaging is the first step,Reusing refillable bottles for example, in addition to enhancing recycling and turning to greener alternatives, are among the report’s recommendations.</p>
                
<p>●“If we can reduce production it significantly help. And then hopefully, as behavioral change increases, we then use alternatives, or we go back to what we used in the past,” .  </p>
<p>● “We need to identify which are the plastics that we still need, and we need to improve infrastructure to recycle.We cannot rely on recycling to fix the problem.”</p>

<p>●Not all plastics are made the same either. So, identifying what type of materials can be recycled — and where — is key. A variety of economic, social, and cultural reasons, including infrastructure, are part of why recycling isn’t always ideal, Besada explains.</p>
    
<p>●However, transitioning to plastic(microplastics) alternatives and  that are less harmful to the environment would also help, which the report describes as reorientation and diversification.</p>
